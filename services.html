	<h1>OUR SERVICES INCLUDE</h1>

	<p>Welcome to our Puppies Adoption Service!

        We are a team of passionate and dedicated animal lovers<br>
             who work hard to rescue and care for puppies in need. <br> 
             mission is to match these adorable puppies with loving<br>
              and responsible families who can provide them with the permanent homes they deserve.
        
        Our adoption service process is simple, easy and transparent.<br>
         Below are the steps involved in adopting your favorite puppy:
         <h2>SERVICE PROCEDURE</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Step 1: Browse our Puppy Profiles
        
            Our website features profiles of all the puppies that are currently available for adoption. Each profile comes with a photo and detailed information about the puppy's age, breed, and temperament.
            </li>
		<li>Step 2: Submit an Adoption Application
        
            Once you have found a puppy that you would like to adopt, please fill out our online adoption application form. The application form will ask you for basic information about yourself, your lifestyle, and your experience with dogs. It helps us understand if you are the right match for the puppy you are interested in.
            </li>
		<li>Step 3: Meet and Greet the Puppy
        
            After receiving your adoption application form, we will contact you to schedule an appointment for you to meet the puppy in person. This will give you an opportunity to get to know the puppy, ask questions, and see if you both are a good match for each other.
            </li>
        <li> Step 4: Adoption Contract and Fees
        
            If you and the puppy are a compatible match, we will then require you to sign an adoption contract and pay a small adoption fee. The adoption fee helps us cover the cost for vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and other expenses related to caring for our puppies.
            </li>
        <li>Step 5: Take your Puppy home!
        
            Congratulations! After completing the steps above, you are now ready to take your new furry friend home. We also offer resources such as pet care guides, training tips, and information about local pet services like veterinarians and dog trainers to help you provide the best care to your new puppy.
            
            At our Puppies Adoption Service, we pride ourselves on making the puppy adoption process as smooth and stress-free as possible. We believe that every puppy deserves a loving and responsible home, and we work hard to match our puppies with the best families out there. Contact us today to start the process of adopting your dream puppy!</li>
